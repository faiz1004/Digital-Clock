This Digital Clock project is a simple yet visually appealing web-based clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM, along with the current date in a readable format. The clock is updated every second in real-time, ensuring accurate timekeeping.

Key Features:
Real-Time Time Updates: The clock refreshes every second using JavaScript's setInterval().
12-Hour Format with AM/PM: Time is displayed in the 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator, making it user-friendly.
Date Display: The current date is shown in a readable format beneath the clock (e.g., Monday, January 31, 2025).
Dark & Light Mode: A toggle button allows users to switch between a dark and light theme, making it adaptable to different lighting preferences.
Smooth Animations: CSS animations provide a smooth fade-in effect, creating a polished and dynamic user experience.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For the basic structure of the page.
CSS: For styling and animations, with support for responsive design and dark/light mode.
JavaScript: For real-time updates of the clock and handling the dark/light mode toggle.
This project is designed to be a clean and user-friendly digital clock that can be easily integrated into any web page, offering a modern and interactive interface.
